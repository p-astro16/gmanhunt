## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Nexus" is nil or Lua errors about Nexus
**Solution:** 
- Nexus Library v2 is NOT installed
- Subscribe to Workshop ID: 2820026045
- Restart Garry's Mod completely
- Verify Nexus loads BEFORE Manhunt (check console)

### Issue: F4 doesn't open menu
**Solution:**
- Try `manhunt_menu` in console instead
- Check if another addon uses F4
- Verify Nexus Library is loaded

### Issue: "Command not found"
**Solution:** Addon not loaded. Check `garrysmod/addons/` folder structure.

### Issue: Black surveillance feed
**Solution:** Map lighting issue or fugitive not valid. Try different map.

### Issue: Timers not appearing
**Solution:** HUD may be hidden. Press F1 or check HUD settings.

### Issue: Emergency weapon not working
**Solution:** 
- Check ammo (only 3 shots)
- Must be in active phase (not headstart)
- Must be the hunter

### Issue: Can't move during headstart
**Solution:** This is intentional! Hunter is frozen during first interval.

### Issue: "Invalid hunter/fugitive"
**Solution:** Use exact player names or partial match. Use `manhunt_players` to list.
