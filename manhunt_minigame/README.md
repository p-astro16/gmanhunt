- Check ammo count (default: 3 shots)
- Verify you're the hunter
- Must be in active phase

**Q: Hunter can't move during headstart**
- This is intentional! Hunter is frozen during first interval
- Wait for "HEADSTART" indicator to disappear

**Q: Timers not syncing**
- Check server tick rate
- Verify network connection
- Try `manhunt_reset` and restart

**Q: Can't see surveillance feed**
